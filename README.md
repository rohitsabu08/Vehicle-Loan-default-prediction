# Vehicle-Loan-default-prediction

Financial institutions often face significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and there is an increase in vehicle loan rejection rates.

The need for a better credit risk predicting model is what is demanded by these institutions. This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicle loan default.

A financial institution has a requirement to accurately predict the probability of loanee/borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan.

Following Information regarding the loan and loanee are taken into consideration in the datasets:

○ Loanee Information (Demographic data like age, Identity proof etc.)

○ Loan Information (Disbursal details, loan to value ratio etc.)

○ Bureau data & history (Bureau score, number of active accounts, the status of other loans, credit history etc.)

This project will help to ensure that clients who are capable of repayment are not rejected and important determinants can be identified which can be further used for minimizing the default rates on these loans.
